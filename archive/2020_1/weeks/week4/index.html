<h1 class="title">Week 4 Vim Tutor</h1>
<p>You can access this tutorial just by typing <code>vimtutor</code> in your shell!</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>===============================================================================
</span><span>=    W e l c o m e   t o   t h e   V I M   T u t o r    -    Version 1.7      =
</span><span>===============================================================================
</span><span>
</span><span>     Vim is a very powerful editor that has many commands, too many to
</span><span>     explain in a tutor such as this.  This tutor is designed to describe
</span><span>     enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use Vim as
</span><span>     an all-purpose editor.
</span><span>
</span><span>     The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 30 minutes,
</span><span>     depending upon how much time is spent with experimentation.
</span><span>
</span><span>     ATTENTION:
</span><span>     The commands in the lessons will modify the text.  Make a copy of this
</span><span>     file to practice on (if you started &quot;vimtutor&quot; this is already a copy).
</span><span>
</span><span>     It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by
</span><span>     use.  That means that you need to execute the commands to learn them
</span><span>     properly.  If you only read the text, you will forget the commands!
</span><span>
</span><span>     Now, make sure that your Caps-Lock key is NOT depressed and press
</span><span>     the   j   key enough times to move the cursor so that lesson 1.1
</span><span>     completely fills the screen.
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>			Lesson 1.1:  MOVING THE CURSOR
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>   ** To move the cursor, press the h,j,k,l keys as indicated. **
</span><span>	     ^
</span><span>	     k		    Hint:  The h key is at the left and moves left.
</span><span>       &lt; h	 l &gt;		   The l key is at the right and moves right.
</span><span>	     j			   The j key looks like a down arrow.
</span><span>	     v
</span><span>  1. Move the cursor around the screen until you are comfortable.
</span><span>
</span><span>  2. Hold down the down key (j) until it repeats.
</span><span>     Now you know how to move to the next lesson.
</span><span>
</span><span>  3. Using the down key, move to lesson 1.2.
</span><span>
</span><span>NOTE: If you are ever unsure about something you typed, press &lt;ESC&gt; to place
</span><span>      you in Normal mode.  Then retype the command you wanted.
</span><span>
</span><span>NOTE: The cursor keys should also work.  But using hjkl you will be able to
</span><span>      move around much faster, once you get used to it.  Really!
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>			    Lesson 1.2: EXITING VIM

</span><span>     This exits the editor, DISCARDING any changes you have made.
</span><span>
</span><span>  3. Get back here by executing the command that got you into this tutor. That
</span><span>     might be:  vimtutor &lt;ENTER&gt;
</span><span>
</span><span>  4. If you have these steps memorized and are confident, execute steps
</span><span>     1 through 3 to exit and re-enter the editor.
</span><span>
</span><span>NOTE:  :q! &lt;ENTER&gt;  discards any changes you made.  In a few lessons you

</span><span>  5. Move on to lesson 2.3 to understand what is happening.
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>		     Lesson 2.3: ON OPERATORS AND MOTIONS
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  Many commands that change text are made from an operator and a motion.
</span><span>  The format for a delete command with the  d  delete operator is as follows:
</span><span>
</span><span>  	d   motion
</span><span>
</span><span>  Where:
</span><span>    d      - is the delete operator.
</span><span>    motion - is what the operator will operate on (listed below).
</span><span>
</span><span>  A short list of motions:
</span><span>    w - until the start of the next word, EXCLUDING its first character.
</span><span>    e - to the end of the current word, INCLUDING the last character.
</span><span>    $ - to the end of the line, INCLUDING the last character.
</span><span>
</span><span>  Thus typing  de  will delete from the cursor to the end of the word.
</span><span>
</span><span>NOTE:  Pressing just the motion while in Normal mode without an operator will
</span><span>       move the cursor as specified.
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>		     Lesson 2.4: USING A COUNT FOR A MOTION
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>   ** Typing a number before a motion repeats it that many times. **
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. Move the cursor to the start of the line below marked ---&gt;.
</span><span>
</span><span>  2. Type  2w  to move the cursor two words forward.
</span><span>
</span><span>  3. Type  3e  to move the cursor to the end of the third word forward.
</span><span>
</span><span>  4. Type  0  (zero) to move to the start of the line.
</span><span>
</span><span>  5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with different numbers.
</span><span>
</span><span>---&gt; This is just a line with words you can move around in.
</span><span>
</span><span>  6. Move on to lesson 2.5.
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>		     Lesson 2.5: USING A COUNT TO DELETE MORE
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>   ** Typing a number with an operator repeats it that many times. **
</span><span>
</span><span>  In the combination of the delete operator and a motion mentioned above you
</span><span>  insert a count before the motion to delete more:
</span><span>	 d   number   motion
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. Move the cursor to the first UPPER CASE word in the line marked ---&gt;.
</span><span>
</span><span>  2. Type  d2w  to delete the two UPPER CASE words.
</span><span>
</span><span>  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with a different count to delete the consecutive
</span><span>     UPPER CASE words with one command.
</span><span>
</span><span>---&gt;  this ABC DE line FGHI JK LMN OP of words is Q RS TUV cleaned up.
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>			 Lesson 2.6: OPERATING ON LINES
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>		   ** Type  dd   to delete a whole line. **
</span><span>
</span><span>  Due to the frequency of whole line deletion, the designers of Vi decided
</span><span>  it would be easier to simply type two d&#39;s to delete a line.
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. Move the cursor to the second line in the phrase below.
</span><span>  2. Type  dd  to delete the line.
</span><span>  3. Now move to the fourth line.
</span><span>  4. Type   2dd   to delete two lines.
</span><span>
</span><span>---&gt;  1)  Roses are red,
</span><span>---&gt;  2)  Mud is fun,
</span><span>---&gt;  3)  Violets are blue,
</span><span>---&gt;  4)  I have a car,
</span><span>---&gt;  5)  Clocks tell time,
</span><span>---&gt;  6)  Sugar is sweet
</span><span>---&gt;  7)  And so are you.
</span><span>
</span><span>Doubling to operate on a line also works for operators mentioned below
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>			 Lesson 2.7: THE UNDO COMMAND
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>   ** Press  u	to undo the last commands,   U  to fix a whole line. **
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked ---&gt; and place it on the
</span><span>     first error.
</span><span>  2. Type  x  to delete the first unwanted character.
</span><span>  3. Now type  u  to undo the last command executed.
</span><span>  4. This time fix all the errors on the line using the  x  command.
</span><span>  5. Now type a capital  U  to return the line to its original state.
</span><span>  6. Now type  u  a few times to undo the  U  and preceding commands.
</span><span>  7. Now type CTRL-R (keeping CTRL key pressed while hitting R) a few times
</span><span>     to redo the commands (undo the undo&#39;s).
</span><span>
</span><span>---&gt; Fiix the errors oon thhis line and reeplace them witth undo.
</span><span>
</span><span>  8. These are very useful commands.  Now move on to the lesson 2 Summary.

</span><span>		       Lesson 3.4: MORE CHANGES USING c
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>     ** The change operator is used with the same motions as delete. **
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. The change operator works in the same way as delete.  The format is:
</span><span>
</span><span>         c    [number]   motion
</span><span>
</span><span>  2. The motions are the same, such as   w (word) and  $ (end of line).

</span><span>  4. Type  w TEST  , where TEST is a filename that does not exist yet.  Verify
</span><span>     that you see  :&#39;&lt;,&#39;&gt;w TEST  before you press &lt;ENTER&gt;.
</span><span>
</span><span>  5. Vim will write the selected lines to the file TEST.  Use  :!dir  or  :!ls
</span><span>     to see it.  Do not remove it yet!  We will use it in the next lesson.
</span><span>
</span><span>NOTE:  Pressing  v  starts Visual selection.  You can move the cursor around
</span><span>       to make the selection bigger or smaller.  Then you can use an operator
</span><span>       to do something with the text.  For example,  d  deletes the text.

</span><span>		   Lesson 5.4: RETRIEVING AND MERGING FILES
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>       ** To insert the contents of a file, type  :r FILENAME  **
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. Place the cursor just above this line.
</span><span>
</span><span>NOTE:  After executing Step 2 you will see text from lesson 5.3.  Then move
</span><span>       DOWN to see this lesson again.
</span><span>
</span><span>  2. Now retrieve your TEST file using the command   :r TEST   where TEST is
</span><span>     the name of the file you used.
</span><span>     The file you retrieve is placed below the cursor line.
</span><span>
</span><span>  3. To verify that a file was retrieved, cursor back and notice that there
</span><span>     are now two copies of lesson 5.3, the original and the file version.
</span><span>
</span><span>NOTE:  You can also read the output of an external command.  For example,
</span><span>       :r !ls  reads the output of the ls command and puts it below the
</span><span>       cursor.
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>			       Lesson 5 SUMMARY
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  1.  :!command  executes an external command.
</span><span>
</span><span>      Some useful examples are:
</span><span>	 (Windows)	  (Unix)
</span><span>	  :!dir		   :!ls		   -  shows a directory listing.
</span><span>	  :!del FILENAME   :!rm FILENAME   -  removes file FILENAME.
</span><span>
</span><span>  2.  :w FILENAME  writes the current Vim file to disk with name FILENAME.
</span><span>
</span><span>  3.  v  motion  :w FILENAME  saves the Visually selected lines in file
</span><span>      FILENAME.
</span><span>
</span><span>  4.  :r FILENAME  retrieves disk file FILENAME and puts it below the
</span><span>      cursor position.
</span><span>
</span><span>  5.  :r !dir  reads the output of the dir command and puts it below the
</span><span>      cursor position.
</span><span>

</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>			 Lesson 6.1: THE OPEN COMMAND
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span> ** Type  o  to open a line below the cursor and place you in Insert mode. **
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked ---&gt;.
</span><span>
</span><span>  2. Type the lowercase letter  o  to open up a line BELOW the cursor and place
</span><span>     you in Insert mode.
</span><span>
</span><span>  3. Now type some text and press &lt;ESC&gt; to exit Insert mode.
</span><span>
</span><span>---&gt; After typing  o  the cursor is placed on the open line in Insert mode.
</span><span>
</span><span>  4. To open up a line ABOVE the cursor, simply type a capital	O , rather
</span><span>     than a lowercase  o.  Try this on the line below.
</span><span>
</span><span>---&gt; Open up a line above this by typing O while the cursor is on this line.
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>			Lesson 6.2: THE APPEND COMMAND
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>	     ** Type  a  to insert text AFTER the cursor. **
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. Move the cursor to the start of the first line below marked ---&gt;.
</span><span>
</span><span>  2. Press  e  until the cursor is on the end of  li .
</span><span>
</span><span>  3. Type an  a  (lowercase) to append text AFTER the cursor.
</span><span>
</span><span>  4. Complete the word like the line below it.  Press &lt;ESC&gt; to exit Insert
</span><span>     mode.
</span><span>
</span><span>  5. Use  e  to move to the next incomplete word and repeat steps 3 and 4.
</span><span>
</span><span>---&gt; This li will allow you to pract appendi text to a line.
</span><span>---&gt; This line will allow you to practice appending text to a line.
</span><span>
</span><span>NOTE:  a, i and A all go to the same Insert mode, the only difference is where
</span><span>       the characters are inserted.
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>		    Lesson 6.3: ANOTHER WAY TO REPLACE
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      ** Type a capital  R  to replace more than one character. **
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked ---&gt;.  Move the cursor to
</span><span>     the beginning of the first  xxx .

</span><span>     replaces the xxx .
</span><span>
</span><span>  3. Press &lt;ESC&gt; to leave Replace mode.  Notice that the rest of the line
</span><span>     remains unmodified.
</span><span>
</span><span>  4. Repeat the steps to replace the remaining xxx.
</span><span>
</span><span>---&gt; Adding 123 to xxx gives you xxx.
</span><span>---&gt; Adding 123 to 456 gives you 579.
</span><span>
</span><span>NOTE:  Replace mode is like Insert mode, but every typed character deletes an
</span><span>       existing character.
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>			Lesson 6.4: COPY AND PASTE TEXT
</span><span>

</span><span>
</span><span>  NOTE: You can also use  y  as an operator:  yw  yanks one word,
</span><span>        yy  yanks the whole line, then  p  puts that line
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>			    Lesson 6.5: SET OPTION
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>	  ** Set an option so a search or substitute ignores case **
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. Search for &#39;ignore&#39; by entering:  /ignore &lt;ENTER&gt;
</span><span>     Repeat several times by pressing  n .
</span><span>
</span><span>  2. Set the &#39;ic&#39; (Ignore case) option by entering:   :set ic

</span><span>		       Lesson 7.1: GETTING HELP
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>		      ** Use the on-line help system **
</span><span>
</span><span>  Vim has a comprehensive on-line help system.  To get started, try one of
</span><span>  these three:
</span><span>	- press the &lt;HELP&gt; key (if you have one)
</span><span>	- press the &lt;F1&gt; key (if you have one)
</span><span>	- type   :help &lt;ENTER&gt;
</span><span>
</span><span>  Read the text in the help window to find out how the help works.
</span><span>  Type  CTRL-W CTRL-W   to jump from one window to another.
</span><span>  Type    :q &lt;ENTER&gt;    to close the help window.
</span><span>
</span><span>  You can find help on just about any subject, by giving an argument to the
</span><span>  &quot;:help&quot; command.  Try these (don&#39;t forget pressing &lt;ENTER&gt;):
</span><span>
</span><span>	:help w
</span><span>	:help c_CTRL-D
</span><span>	:help insert-index
</span><span>	:help user-manual
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>		      Lesson 7.2: CREATE A STARTUP SCRIPT
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>			  ** Enable Vim features **
</span><span>
</span><span>  Vim has many more features than Vi, but most of them are disabled by
</span><span>  default.  To start using more features you have to create a &quot;vimrc&quot; file.
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. Start editing the &quot;vimrc&quot; file.  This depends on your system:
</span><span>	:e ~/.vimrc		for Unix
</span><span>	:e $VIM/_vimrc		for Windows
</span><span>
</span><span>  2. Now read the example &quot;vimrc&quot; file contents:
</span><span>	:r $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim
</span><span>
</span><span>  3. Write the file with:
</span><span>	:w
</span><span>
</span><span>  The next time you start Vim it will use syntax highlighting.
</span><span>  You can add all your preferred settings to this &quot;vimrc&quot; file.
</span><span>  For more information type  :help vimrc-intro
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>			     Lesson 7.3: COMPLETION
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>	      ** Command line completion with CTRL-D and &lt;TAB&gt; **
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. Make sure Vim is not in compatible mode:  :set nocp
</span><span>
</span><span>  2. Look what files exist in the directory:  :!ls   or  :!dir
</span><span>
</span><span>  3. Type the start of a command:  :e
</span><span>
</span><span>  4. Press  CTRL-D  and Vim will show a list of commands that start with &quot;e&quot;.
</span><span>
</span><span>  5. Type  d&lt;TAB&gt;  and Vim will complete the command name to &quot;:edit&quot;.
</span><span>
</span><span>  6. Now add a space and the start of an existing file name:  :edit FIL
</span><span>
</span><span>  7. Press &lt;TAB&gt;.  Vim will complete the name (if it is unique).
</span><span>
</span><span>NOTE:  Completion works for many commands.  Just try pressing CTRL-D and
</span><span>       &lt;TAB&gt;.  It is especially useful for  :help .
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>			       Lesson 7 SUMMARY
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  1. Type  :help  or press &lt;F1&gt; or &lt;HELP&gt;  to open a help window.
</span><span>
</span><span>  2. Type  :help cmd  to find help on  cmd .
</span><span>
</span><span>  3. Type  CTRL-W CTRL-W  to jump to another window.
</span><span>
</span><span>  4. Type  :q  to close the help window.
</span><span>
</span><span>  5. Create a vimrc startup script to keep your preferred settings.
</span><span>
</span><span>  6. When typing a  :  command, press CTRL-D to see possible completions.
</span><span>     Press &lt;TAB&gt; to use one completion.
</span><span>

</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</span><span>
</span><span>  This concludes the Vim Tutor.  It was intended to give a brief overview of
</span><span>  the Vim editor, just enough to allow you to use the editor fairly easily.
</span><span>  It is far from complete as Vim has many many more commands.  Read the user
</span><span>  manual next: &quot;:help user-manual&quot;.
</span><span>
</span><span>  For further reading and studying, this book is recommended:
</span><span>	Vim - Vi Improved - by Steve Oualline
</span><span>	Publisher: New Riders
</span><span>  The first book completely dedicated to Vim.  Especially useful for beginners.
</span><span>  There are many examples and pictures.
</span><span>  See http://iccf-holland.org/click5.html
</span><span>
</span><span>  This book is older and more about Vi than Vim, but also recommended:
</span><span>	Learning the Vi Editor - by Linda Lamb
</span><span>	Publisher: O&#39;Reilly &amp; Associates Inc.
</span><span>  It is a good book to get to know almost anything you want to do with Vi.
</span><span>  The sixth edition also includes information on Vim.
</span><span>
