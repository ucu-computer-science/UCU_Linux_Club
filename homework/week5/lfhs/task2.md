## The video

Now this is the 2nd part of your homework regarding LFHS. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmdhn2R8_J0) video on my YT channel. Your job is to write out **ALL** mistakes/inaccurate statements that I made in that video(There is about 15, I think).

Write them down below :)
~ in username dir that is in home dir
sbin doesn't contain any boot or recovery files	
sbin acces by all users
user not links to a root dir
\tmp not mentioned
\proc creating during boot
