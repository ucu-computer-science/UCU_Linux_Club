#### Arch Linux installation
Arch Linux itself is not very simple for beginners, but amazing 
if you want to know the system better. Here are a few links where
you can read more about Arch Linux installation.

The most difficult stuff for the beginner is Arch installation and graphics. 
The best manual for that is located 
[on Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide). 

If you want to have several operating systems running alongside each other, you can look at
[this manual](https://sollus-soft.blogspot.com/2017/01/arch-linux-windows-10-uefi-systemd-boot.html)

Also, if you want a slightly simpler manual than the Arch wiki one, you can read 
[this one](https://sollus-soft.blogspot.com/2017/01/arch-linux-64-uefi-systemd-boot-grub.html). 

And the instruction about graphic drivers installation can be found 
[here](https://ziggi.org/ustanovka-i-nastroyka-arch-linux-xfce-chast-1/).
But you don\`t need XFCE, instead you need [GNOME](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME).
